# My startup
Ever wanted to become something more, to be someone better? To start now, just create atomic habits! That's where my startup comes in. It helps aces and amateurs create these small and simple habits in the snap of a finger.

## Key Features
### Personal Data
Your privacy matters, so your atomic habits are just for you (but sharing them with your friends wouldn't hurt :D)

### Atomic Habit Maker
This is the main feature of the startup. It gives the user an easy format to create atomic habits

### Beginner's Guide
Confused on what atomic habits are? Can't think of any ideas? Don't sweat it, because it will include a simple guide to get you started.

### Browse your Habit Library
As you submit atomic habits, it will save your atomic habits so you can "make it obvious" in your life!

### Atomic Counter
This global counter shows how many atomic habits all users have collectively created! The power of small and simple things, eh?

## Technologies
### HTML
I will use HTML to add structure to my startup as the framework for the visual and interactive components of the pages.
### CSS
I will use CSS to add style to my startup as the decoration and visually pleasing aspects of the pages so the user can have a pleasurable experience creating atomic habits.
### Javascript
I will use Javascript to add functionality and interactive elements to my startup to enable users to navigate between pages and brainstorm their atomic habits.
### Web Services
I will use a web service to find a random photo from a collection of motivating images, and also another web service to find random motivational quotes. I will post both of these items on the top of each page on the website.
### Authentication
I will have users log in with appropriate login info so that they can privately save and view the atomic habits they submitted.
### Database persistence
I will store the atomic habits that users submit into a database so to protect this data from being lost on the client's browser or the server.
### WebSocket
Whenever someone submits a new atomic habit, I will update the global counter for the total amount of atomic habits created. Then I will live-sync this with any open instances of the website.
